<h1>How to use shelly properly?</h1>
<body>
<p>To start off, letâ€™s quickly review the mechanics of Shelly and her attack.

    If you are between 0 to 1.5 tiles of your target, then Shelly will hit that target will use all 5 of her shells, meaning she will do 5 times more damage at very <br>
     close range than from far away.If she shoots between 1.6 to 3.5 tiles, then she will hit her target <br>
     with 3 shells, meaning  she will do 3 times as much damage than she would have done <br>
     if she was to shoot from more than 3.5 tiles away</p>
     <h2>Use these tiles</h2>

     <h3>Shelly vs Colt</h3> <p>Colt Is a tough matchup for Shelly because Colt has more range than her and he <br>

        also does so much more damage than Shelly from far away. <br>
        
        In order for Shelly to beat Colt, you will need to utilize walls as much as you can and try to get as close to Colt as possible.
        <br>
        Remember, Shelly does most of her damage when she is within 3.5 tiles of her target, so
        
        <br>if you can get within 3.5 tiles of Colt while holding onto full ammo, you can quickly auto tap all 3 ammo on him and beat him.
        
        <br>And although Colt does so much damage, he is one of the easier brawlers to dodge attacks
        
        from, so a big tip for dodging his attacks is to stay about 3 to 5 tiles away from him
        
        while moving left and right to dodge him.If you get too close without dodging him, then he will shred you with his auto tapped attack.<br>
        
       <br> <h4>Shelly vs Nita</h4> <P>Against Nita, Shelly has about 1 tile advantage against her
        
        So to beat her, you must use Shellyâ€™s full range to slowly chip health from Nita while keeping distance from her so she canâ€™t damage you. If Nita rushes you, simply run back while shooting and you will easily beat her. 
        
        Slowly dealing chip damage on her will allow you to charge your super, and when you are
        
        close to your super, you can rush in on her and easily destroy her with your super.
        
        If she uses her Super bear, then best thing to do would be to run away from Nitaâ€™s range,
        
        while shooting at the bear.
        
        This way you can take out the bear without taking any damage.</p>
